*Disclaimer: this theme is free and currently indev*

## About the Grid
Right now, the front page is the only page using CSS grid. The reason being is that most of the pages don't need a grid layout, but I am using flex. No floats and hacks here. 

## Installing
You can use `composer` to include this theme in your Wordpress install, or you can download the repository as a .ZIP and unzip it inside `wp-content/themes`.

## Extending
This theme was built using [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) v8, so you can add your own node modules with NPM, your own front end modules with Bower, and of course, compile with gulp. It works OOB without all of this, and can operate as a regular theme, but its nice to extend.

## Contributing
This theme was built for a client which I currently maintain, so I will fix bugs as I see them. Feel free to find your own and submit fixes as you see fit.

## Other
Look, most of the css needs to be reorganized, I know that, and there are some best practices that I should look at again, but it works. It will get refactored soon, I promise (lol).
